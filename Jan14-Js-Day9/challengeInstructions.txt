Exercise on Working with objects in Javascript 
The main focus is to create a system where we can add Sporters and every sporter has the ability to manage his training-logs. When lots of Sporter are generated with lots of traininglogs we can apply some datascience on the data.
A: SETUP PART
1)     Sporter
Generate a Class Sporter. Every sporter has 4 properties:
·        Firstname
·        LastName
·        Age
·        TrainingLog
2)     Log
 Generate a Class Log. Every Log has 3 properties:
·        Sportstype
·        Distance
·        Time (minutes)
When the 2 classes are created. Create an array of sporters and generate 5000 sporters with a random firstName, lastName, age between (16 and 60) and a TrainingLog with a minimum of 500 and a maximum of 1000 logs. Every log should have a rondom Sport (“swimming”,”running” or “cycling”). According to these sportsTypes generate me some random distance and time(in minutes). Try to be realistic in your randomRange according to the sportsType.
B: DATASCIENCE PART
Add some methods so we can get some statistics
Add the ability to calculate a sporter his total swimming minutes
Add the ability to calculate a sporter his total running kms
sum of all sports kms => Calculate the total distance of all traininglogs of all people
sum of all running km of all sporters => Calculate the total running distance of all traininglogs of all people
average running speed of all sporters => Calculate avg-speed of all running of all people in all logs
person with the longest total swimming distance => search for the first-name, last-name and age of the person that did the longest total swimdistance
person with the longest swim distance log => find the person with the biggest single distance swimtraining
fastest average cycler => Find the guy that is the fastest cycler returning its name and its avg km/h
